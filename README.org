* Jan OS
This simple kernel is an exploration project that I am developing in
my free time, the kernel is for x86 arch I do not know if I will ever move it
to x86_64, the booting process is made with grub and the multiboot1
specs.

** Current Feature
The kernel support logging on serial and VGA text mode there is a
common interface *display* to select witch output stream to use, for
input device only ps2 is supported, all standard x86 interrupt are
mapped and as a default behavior they log there call. There is support
for physical and virtual page allocation but is only 4KiB no 4MiB page
and the implementation of kmalloc(memory allocator) can only handle
allocation of [1, 4096] byte
